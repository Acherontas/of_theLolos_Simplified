# of_theLolos_Simplified
a more simple of_theLolos project

instead of ranges 
u choose 4 number where the sum of digit is equal 
between first and third and second and fourth
some results tends to have different numbers but same cdi 
in between them

//example

acherontas@raspberrypi:~/codeblocks/of_the_Lolos_Simplified_Arm64/bin/Debug $ ./of_the_Lolos_Simplified_Arm64 10 9 46 36 15

enter 4 numbers and a preci 

the first and third must have the same cdi

the second and fourth must have the same cdi

where cdi stands for sum of digit

eg 2785 78895621 22 46 


rs_add 10 + 9 ::== 19 with cdi of  1

rs_pol 10 * 9 ::== 90 with cdi of  9

rs_afair 10 - 9 ::== 1 with cdi of  1

rs_afairone 9 - 10 ::== -1 with cdi of  -1

rs_diair 10 / 9 ::== 1.11111111111111 with cdi of  1

rs_diairone 9 / 10 ::== 0.9 with cdi of  0


rs_add 46 + 36 ::== 82 with cdi of  1

rs_pol 46 * 36 ::== 1656 with cdi of  9

rs_afair 46 - 36 ::== 10 with cdi of  1

rs_afairone 36 - 46 ::== -10 with cdi of  -1

rs_diair 46 / 36 ::== 1.27777777777778 with cdi of  1

rs_diairone 36 / 46 ::== 0.782608695652174 with cdi of  0
